Every component of the conductance matrix has a separate file. 
There are free conductance matrix entries
gll and grr are local concuductances on the left and right respectively. The underscore denotes the data number referenced in the ppt.
The files have a label in the first row. 
The rest of the file are saved in matrix format, where the first two 'columns' are the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.
(It's easiest to just drop them into excel, if unsure about the format)
